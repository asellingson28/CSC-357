Hello! This is my coursework for my class CSC 357, taken at Cal Poly Fall 2025 with Professor Christian Eckhardt. The `cpp`[^1] files are sorted into Labs, PLTLs (Group Labs)[^2], Assignments, and barebone weekly notes taken in VS Code[^3]. The class covered in depth the following topics:
- Pointers and Addresses
- Memory Allocation
- Shared Memory
- Processes & Forks
- Bitmap parsing, editing, reading, and merging
- Sleep timers
- Pipes (dup, dup2)

Files have rudimentary JSDoc/Javadoc comments implemented. Fellow students, please use these files to assist in your code writing, not to plagiarize or cheat. Thanks!

[^1]: Students could choose between `C` and `cpp`; I chose `cpp` due to familiarity with Object Oriented Programming
[^2]: I may or may not have skipped PLTL 6 due to Halloween festivities.
[^3]: Lectures were cancelled post Week 5. Then, larger Assignments were present during the weeks.
